# Building-Deep-Neural-Network

I will implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.

After this assignment you will be able to:

* Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
* Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
* Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
